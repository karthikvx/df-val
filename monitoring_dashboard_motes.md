## Comprehensive model monitoring dashboard for mortgage loan default risk prediction system. 
This dashboard will track model performance, data drift, and business metrics in production using a React component with interactive charts and real-time monitoring capabilities.

## Dashboard Components

**1. Real-time Metrics Overview**
- Key performance indicators (accuracy, precision, daily predictions, error rate)
- Trend indicators showing changes from previous periods
- Auto-refresh functionality with configurable intervals

**2. Model Performance Tracking**
- Interactive time-series charts for all ML metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC)
- Selectable metrics and time ranges
- Visual trend analysis with performance degradation alerts

**3. Data Drift Detection**
- Monitors all key mortgage features (debt-to-income, loan-to-value, credit score, etc.)
- Baseline vs current value comparisons
- Color-coded drift severity indicators
- Statistical significance testing for drift detection

**4. Prediction Distribution Analysis**
- Risk score distribution charts
- Helps identify shifts in prediction patterns
- Useful for detecting model bias or data quality issues

**5. System Performance Monitoring**
- Processing time and throughput metrics
- Error rate tracking
- System health indicators

**6. Alert Management**
- Real-time alerts for performance degradation
- Data drift notifications
- System health alerts with severity levels

## Integration Points

This dashboard would integrate with your existing AWS infrastructure:

- **CloudWatch**: Real-time metrics and logs
- **SageMaker Model Monitor**: Automated data quality and bias detection
- **SageMaker Clarify**: Model explainability and bias metrics
- **EventBridge**: Alert routing and notifications
- **SNS**: Alert delivery to stakeholders

## Production Implementation

For production deployment, you would:

1. **Connect to AWS APIs**: Replace simulated data with real CloudWatch metrics
2. **Add Authentication**: Integrate with AWS Cognito or your auth system
3. **Deploy**: Host on S3 + CloudFront or ECS/Fargate
4. **Configure Alerts**: Set up CloudWatch alarms and SNS notifications
5. **Add Export Features**: PDF reports and data export capabilities

The dashboard provides comprehensive visibility into your model's health and performance, enabling proactive maintenance and ensuring reliable mortgage risk predictions in production.
