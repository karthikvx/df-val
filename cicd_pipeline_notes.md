I can see the CI/CD pipeline file has most of the implementation but was cut off during the model registration script. Let me complete that script and finalize the CI/CD pipeline implementation.Perfect! I've completed the CI/CD pipeline implementation. The `cicd_pipeline.py` now includes:

## Key Features Completed:

### 1. **Complete CodeBuild Projects**
- **Data Validation**: Validates data quality, runs preprocessing, generates data profiles
- **Model Training**: Trains models with hyperparameter optimization, generates reports
- **Model Testing**: Comprehensive testing including functionality, performance, bias, and stability
- **Staging Deployment**: Deploys to staging with integration and load testing
- **Production Deployment**: Blue-green deployment with smoke tests and model registration

### 2. **Advanced Deployment Scripts**
- **Staging Deploy**: Creates SageMaker endpoints with proper configuration
- **Production Deploy**: Implements blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates
- **Model Registration**: Registers models in SageMaker Model Registry with comprehensive metadata

### 3. **Pipeline Management Features**
- **Artifact Management**: S3 bucket creation with versioning and lifecycle policies
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: CloudWatch dashboard for pipeline metrics and logs
- **Notifications**: CloudWatch Events integration for pipeline status alerts
- **Pipeline Control**: Methods to trigger executions and monitor status

### 4. **Production-Ready Features**
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling throughout
- **IAM Role Management**: Automatic creation of necessary service roles
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of old configurations during blue-green deployments
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring

### 5. **Pipeline Stages**
1. **Source** → **Data Validation** → **Model Training** → **Model Testing**
2. **Staging Deployment** → **Manual Approval** → **Production Deployment**

This creates a complete MLOps pipeline that automates the entire machine learning lifecycle from data validation through production deployment, with proper testing, monitoring, and approval gates. The pipeline is designed for the mortgage risk model but can be easily adapted for other ML use cases.

Would you like me to create the final component - the model monitoring dashboard - to complete the full MLOps infrastructure?
