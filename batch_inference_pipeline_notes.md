I'll continue building the batch inference pipeline from where we left off. Looking at the attached file, I can see we have a comprehensive batch inference pipeline started with the MortgageBatchInferencePipeline class and a detailed batch transform script. Let me complete this implementation.Perfect! I've completed the comprehensive batch inference pipeline. This implementation provides:

## Key Features Completed:

### üîÑ **Dual Batch Processing Methods**
- **SageMaker Processing**: For complex preprocessing and custom inference logic
- **Batch Transform**: For straightforward model inference with built-in scaling

### üìä **Comprehensive Results Processing**
- Detailed JSON results with loan-level predictions
- Summary statistics and risk distributions
- Confidence scoring and risk categorization

### ‚úÖ **Validation & Quality Assurance**
- Probability range validation
- Confidence score checks  
- Risk distribution analysis
- Missing prediction detection

### üìà **Business Reporting**
- Executive summaries with key metrics
- Detailed analytics with percentiles
- Business impact analysis
- Actionable recommendations

### ‚è∞ **Scheduling & Monitoring**
- EventBridge + Lambda scheduling support
- Job status monitoring with timeout handling
- SNS notifications for completion/failure

### üîß **Production Features**
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging throughout
- Flexible configuration options
- S3 path management

The pipeline handles the complete workflow from raw loan data through feature engineering, model inference, result validation, and business reporting. It's designed for production use with proper error handling, monitoring, and notification capabilities.

Would you like me to proceed with the **CI/CD automation pipeline** next? This will include CodePipeline configuration for automated model deployment, testing, and promotion across environments.
