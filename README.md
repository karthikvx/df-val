## Summary
Comprehensive approach to implementing a loan default risk model for mortgage loans using AWS services. 

## Architecture Overview

**Core AWS Services:**
- **Amazon SageMaker** - Primary ML platform for training, validation, and deployment
- **Amazon S3** - Data storage and model artifacts
- **AWS Glue** - Data preparation and ETL
- **Amazon RDS/Redshift** - Structured data storage
- **AWS Lambda** - Real-time inference and orchestration
- **Amazon CloudWatch** - Monitoring and logging

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Data Pipeline Setup

**Data Storage (S3):**
```python
# S3 bucket structure
mortgage-loan-ml/
├── raw-data/
├── processed-data/
├── models/
├── validation-results/
└── inference-data/
```

**Data Sources typically include:**
- Borrower demographics and credit history
- Property information and appraisals
- Loan characteristics (amount, term, rate)
- Economic indicators
- Historical default data

### 2. Data Preparation with AWS Glue

```python
# Glue ETL job example
import sys
from awsglue.transforms import *
from awsglue.utils import getResolvedOptions
from pyspark.context import SparkContext
from awsglue.context import GlueContext
from awsglue.job import Job

# Data preprocessing script
def preprocess_mortgage_data(glue_context, input_path, output_path):
    # Load raw data
    raw_data = glue_context.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
        connection_type="s3",
        connection_options={"paths": [input_path]},
        format="csv"
    )
    
    # Feature engineering
    processed_data = raw_data.map(
        lambda record: transform_features(record)
    )
    
    # Write processed data
    glue_context.write_dynamic_frame.from_options(
        processed_data,
        connection_type="s3",
        connection_options={"path": output_path},
        format="parquet"
    )
```

### 3. Model Training with SageMaker

**Training Script (Python):**

### 4. Model Validation Framework

### 5. SageMaker Training Job Configuration

**1. Direct Script Integration:**
- Uses your existing `mortgage_training_script.py` as the entry point
- Uploads both training and validation scripts to S3 automatically
- Handles dependencies through requirements.txt

**2. Simplified Data Flow:**
- Removes redundant preprocessing since training script handles feature engineering
- Passes raw data directly to the training script
- Training script performs its own train/validation split

**3. Comprehensive Validation Pipeline:**
- Integrates `model_validation_script.py` for post-training validation
- Runs validation as a separate SageMaker Processing job
- Generates comprehensive validation reports

**4. Production-Ready Features:**
- Model package registration with metadata
- Optional model deployment functionality
- Complete error handling and logging

## Usage Flow:

1. **Training**: Uses `mortgage_training_script.py` with all its feature engineering
2. **Validation**: Runs comprehensive `MortgageLoanModelValidator` 
3. **Packaging**: Creates versioned model packages for deployment
4. **Monitoring**: Sets up ongoing model monitoring

## Key Benefits:

- **Full MLOps Pipeline**: Training → Validation → Packaging → Deployment
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Leverages SageMaker's managed services
- **Production Monitoring**: Built-in model drift detection

The script now expects training data in parquet format (as per training script) and automatically handles the complete ML lifecycle using existing, comprehensive feature engineering and validation logic.

Would you like me to create the next component, such as:
1. **Real-time inference endpoint configuration**
2. **Batch inference pipeline**
3. **CI/CD automation with CodePipeline**
4. **Model monitoring dashboard**?
